                <p>I love strategy guides.</p>
                <p>It was born out of necessity. My brother and I weren't very good at computer games and generally failed without some kind of ace up our sleeve. We were fortunate in that we could cheat code the living crap out of some of our games (my brother found it very convenient when Santa gave us not only a cheat cartridge, but had also procured the codes for many of our games for it too). Others, we weren't so lucky.</p>
                <p>That's where the strategy guides came in.</p>
                <p>Often it was in gaming magazines. But for the particularly thorny titles, I'd go one step further and get the book. My brother felt it excessive and was more content with just getting his ass kicked on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>As such, my dad and I used to tag-team <cite>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines</cite> on the computer. He'd sit next to me with the strategy guide in hand, reading out the next set of instructions for me to dutifully carry out.</p>
                <p>From that point, it made no sense to leave home without one. This was especially true if you had a cruel mistress like <cite>Final Fantasy</cite>. I didn't so much mind when things were well-hidden, it was more when they'd lure you to the exit with feigned urgency then yell "PSYCHE!" as they locked the door behind you, trapping away any goodies you missed for the rest of time. I blame that in part for my gaming compulsion to ignore the bit I'm told is important and to instead rummage around everything else first.</p>
                <p>Knowledge was power. Even if that meant the only way I could get any pointers on the final boss of <cite>Team Buddies</cite> was to sit with a German dictionary and poorly translate a random guide on the internet.</p>
                <p>I gave that power up in <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>, however.</p>
                <p>When getting antsy at being so in the dark in the opening stages of the game, I was fortunate to read a description of the game that basically explained that this was the whole point. Feeling your way around a strange world and being drip-fed information was, in part, half the fun. Given the assurance that this was by design and I wasn't just being thick... I decided to let myself be blindfolded and play along.</p>
                <p>As expected, I walked into several poles and landed squarely in several of the game designers' traps. There was, however, a really exciting element to this I hadn't seen in a long time. It was surprise.</p>
                <p>Having no idea of how big the game's world was, every new area was an exciting new mystery. I'd see new and unusual creatures wandering about (and ran away screaming from several of them). Tracking an innocuous tunnel only to be rewarded with an expanded new realm and new music was such a treat.</p>
                <p>It was a treat that I'd only seen once before... and that was in <cite>Pokemon Gold/Silver</cite>. For the entirety of the game, they sold you the scale of the map with a perfectly straight face. As they lead you to the final challenge, they suddenly yelled "PSYCHE!" and revealled the entire region from the first set of games, right next door to yours. The map had basically doubled right as you neared what you believed was the finale. Speaking to my old housemate, John, it was fascinating to hear that he too, had the same shock and excitement when that grand reveal was played.</p>
                <p>Though played in very different ways, <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>'s surprises hit those same chords beautifully. The more it revealed, the happier I was to stay in the dark.</p>
