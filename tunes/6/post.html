                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Coldplay</p>

                <p>I suppose with all of these musical covers that I should probably make a confession... I <em>hated</em> music as a kid.</p>
                <p>Not disliked. Hated. This wasn't one of those things that you'd go all coy and quip "<em>oh it's just not my cup of tea</em>". With the face I'd make, the proverbial tea that was handed to me might as well have been scooped out of a compost bin.</p>
                <p>I don't know why I had such venomous aninomsity towards it. It's not like I was skimped for musical influences either... My mum listened to Classic FM, my dad ranged from Dylan to the Rolling Stones, and my brother was into the likes of Oasis or Stereophonics, being the bad-boy rocker he is.</p>
                <p>Me, on the other hand, would cite the Spice Girls as my favourite band at primary school solely because I found it was the answer which tended to successfully prevent any further pressing about my musical tastes. I'd then hide in the corner at school discos with my fingers plugged firmly into my ears.</p>
                <p>It was horrible. Instead of playing with Lego or running off on my own little adventure, I was placed into a darkened room of strobe lighting and told that "fun" involved me having to jump up and down whilst "reaching for the stars" with every other hyperactive kid juiced up on soft drinks that were filled with goodness-knows-what back in those days. Jumping up and down, that I was game for. But why was I being shouted at by people with shiny teeth waving their arms about like a semaphore whack-a-mole?</p>
                <p>Heck, I was even given a kid's acoustic guitar to play with. But after being unimpressed that the song on offer was Old McDonald's farm and hearing "E, I, E, I, O" plucked slowly and torturously from the strings, I let it gather dust whilst I ran off and drew cartoons instead (sorry dad).</p>
                <p>I was raised on a beautiful balanced diet of musical tastes, and came away eating little more than prawn crackers.</p>
                <p>The only exception was, as you might be able to guess from the other posts, computer game music. It was the only thing that I'd say I hummed or really "rocked out to" (unless you count the theme tunes to cartoons, which I could still probably recount word-for-word if you asked nicely). Whilst the 90's still had people making mix-tapes recorded from the radio (praying that the twonk of a DJ wouldn't speak over it), I made mine from the TV when playing video games. Beyond that though, music - and <em>especially</em> singing - were dead to me. (Although I'll concede that the Bugsy Malone tunes were a lot of fun)</p>
                <p>Now I don't know what clicked as a teenager... All I remember is, one-by-one, not hating a handful of songs. I have no explanation why other than "hormones or some crap" but all I know is that, in the midst of my angsty teenage years, a few songs suddenly sounded... <em>nice</em>? Could it be? Was I actually enjoying a song?</p>
                <p>Like a wretched castaway who'd just been brought back to civilisation, I cautiously approached this new food, sniffing at it and occasionally scurrying back to my familiar coconuts.</p>
                <p><em>Trouble</em> was one such song. I had known of it but little else. Any company wanting to guilt you into giving you their money often used it, which immediately black-listed it for me. But hey, at least it wasn't <cite>Everybody Hurts</cite>. Having got into Coldplay in the X&amp;Y era, I was obviously intrigued to go and check out their earlier albums, at which point I found myself remarking "Wait, <em>this</em> is them??" as my brother actually had both of their first albums (Whoosh. There goes his bad-boy rocker status. Sorry bro).</p>
                <p>He hated this song. And, in his defence, I was kinda lukewarm to it either.</p>
                <p>That was, until the piano came along. Being one of Coldplay's well-known pieces, and relatively easy to play, how could it <em>not</em> be one of the ports I visited? I think it was my third or fourth.</p>
                <p>Following my frustration of not knowing how I wanted my piano playing to sound, this one curiously came back to the rescue. In wanting to find a musical style with a bit more finesse, the naturally quiet piano-driven song made for an obvious segue to try and get a feel for how I wanted to develop. The verse had more pauses and I found myself enjoying the teasing slowness of the later chord changes. Though I didn't find the song especially rivetting to listen to, I found it a lot of fun to play.</p>
