                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>Ironically for its name, this was one of the few survivors of the lost piano tracks that I used to know how to play.</p>
                <p>Back in 2013, I succeeded in what seemed like a pretty tough challenge. Within a year, I had learned the entirety of Coldplay's <cite>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</cite> on piano. Every song, from start to finish.</p>
                <p>What greeted me at the finish line, however, wasn't a plucky feather in my cap, but a piano version of an existential crisis. I know, I know, I would preferred a washing machine instead.</p>
                <p>The problem was simple: I hated the sound of pretty much all of it (which, beating a few people to the obvious joke, wasn't strictly down to my choice of source material). Once the novelty of "oh it's this song!" wore off, I found myself staring at little more than a muddled quagmire of chords and not much else. Though the pieces were faithful renditions (in terms of tempo and what notes were played), I was waking up to the reality of the limitations of my craft: A piano is not a four-piece ensemble and never will be.</p>
                <p>In hindsight, that probably should have been pretty obvious. If a piano could replace everything multiple instruments could do, several bands would be out of a job. It's versatile, but it's not a band, much like how glamping pretends to be anything more than a miserable experience under a glorified bit of fabric. "It's just like we're in a hotel" it coos seductively, "only not as good" as it backs up your plumbing for the twelfth time.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for me, I was now stalled in what to do with piano as my glamping gazebo had gone up in flames and, like in a cartoon, I was left with little more than a charred outline of the tent and a surprised expression on my face. Whilst I came to the piano to play my favourite tunes, I was realising that they'd simply never sound as good. It knocked my enthusiasm for six and, one by one, the pieces started falling off my radar and out of practice.</p>
                <p>The only survivor of that album was this one (at least for now). Though it's not even one of my favourites, it was one of the ones I liked the sound of most on the piano, likely because Lost? <em>is</em> the official piano cover of Lost! (yes, the punctutation is apparently important), so the piano arrangement was built-in already. It became a benchmark and starting point for trying to figure out where I wanted to go with the piano. Note-for-note accuracy was no longer cutting it. Whether I <em>could</em> play a piece was no longer as important as whether I <em>liked</em> it.</p>
                <p>From there, Lost? became the first babystep to trying to play to the piano's strengths, rather than trying to live up to a band. I didn't change much, aside from sneaking in some extra bass notes (and feeling very naughty in the process) and rolling the odd chord here and there. But it was enough to whet the appetite and start the road to finding a piano style I enjoyed.</p>
