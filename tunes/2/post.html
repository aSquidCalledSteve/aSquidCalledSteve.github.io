                <h2>Fisherman's Horizon [Piano Cover]</h2>
                <ul class="summary">
                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Nobuo Uematsu</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Game:</h3><p>Final Fantasy VIII</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Heard in:</h3><p>Fisherman's Horizon, where I'd love to holiday were it not for the almost guaranteed permanent smell of fish</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>I replayed <cite>Final Fantasy VIII</cite> in my mid-teens, this time with a score to settle.</p>
                <p>That score was with myself.</p>
                <p>Though I had beaten the game previously, I confess that I had used my <cite>Action Replay</cite> mid-way through Disc 3 to jack up my characters' stats after getting my ass kicked by Bahamut. If you haven't come across one before, an <cite>Action Replay</cite> basically lets you cheat.</p>
                <p>Whilst not indestructable, my juiced up characters pretty much made the closing chapters and secret bosses a cinch. Unfortunately for me, they also ruined the game.</p>
                <p>Almost immediately after applying the stats and saving (the point of no return), I regretted the decision. The strange thing about this is that I'd grown up using cheat codes to make games playable (hey, I was rubbish, ok?). Infinite lives on <cite>Puggsy</cite>? Hit me up. Infinite health in <cite>World of Illusion</cite>? My brother and I definitely needed it with the amount we'd sabotage each other. Meeting Caesar's formidable legionaries head-on with laser-toting storm troopers? How else do you play <cite>Age of Empires</cite>?</p>
                <p>Weirdly though, by my teens and when I was actually competent at gaming, I had developed an almost martial pride with games. Beating the game by its own rules became far more satisfying than just winning. Though I realistically could have reached the <cite>Final Fantasy VIII</cite> stats with bit more playing and know-how of the mechanics, I had now robbed myself of the satisfaction of doing so. Beating Omega Weapon was now nothing like helping my brother beat Cerberus with his crappy team (he didn't acually train them), with him even cheering me on when it came close to the wire. That was a win. Sleepwalking your way through the final boss (and their final form, and their final-final form...) was not.</p>
                <p>That may have even been the last time I ever used a cheat code.</p>
                <p>So I returned. This time, the only assistance was a carefully curated spreadsheet of how I was going to customise my team (written in fountain pen no less). I had a plan, and the rest was on me.</p>
                <p>What marked that playthrough, however, though wasn't the lack of cheating or the questionable amount of time spent handwriting a spreadsheet... It was Fisherman's Horizon; A small harbour-like town built on top of a transcontinental bridge.</p>
                <p>At the point that you <strike>crash into</strike> visit Fisherman's Horizon and disembark from your T-Rex-ridden university hovercraft (don't ask), you are greeted with this absolutely beautiful tune. I came here for the trading cards, but most definitely stuck around for the music.</p>
                <p>Then I did something I never had. I put the controller down.</p>
                <p>I had always had a soft spot for games soundtracks, but I'd enjoy them as part of playing the game. I had never stopped to just take in the music on its own. It was at once surreal and incredibly serene. It was the sort of music where I could drop my worries to one side and come relax for a bit.</p>
                <p>I purposefully took my sweet time walking around Fisherman's Horizon and chatting to the locals. Considering the entire game had you sprinting around, barging into people's houses as the default, walking was something that you had to go out of your way to do. Weirder still, walking around a city and just <em>looking</em> at things is tantamount to torture for me. My style is "okay, I've looked at it. Can we go home now?."</p>
                <p>But I didn't want to leave.</p>
                <p>The music was far too captivating and, as an angsty teenager with a chip on my shoulder the size of Montana, such a respite was almost dream-like. I was particularly fortunate as the PlayStation was in my brother's and my bedroom at the time, so I was able to lay back on my bed and just let the music sink in. Whilst I'm sure my peers probably had "cooler" ways to unwind... I'll just have this track played on loop, thank you.</p>
                <p>As I made my way back to my T-Rex-ridden university hovercraft, knowing I wouldn't be able to visit again once I had compressed time to visit a past-witch who was wrecking the future with an imprisoned space witch (don't ask), I stopped by the exit and let the song play once more on loop. One more for the road, as they say.</p>
                <p>Fast forward several years with my discovery of the piano and rediscovery of the <cite>Final Fantasy</cite> soundtracks... well... I'm sure you can guess the rest. This piece was a complete no-brainer.</p>
                <p>However, the echoes of redemption from my playthrough lived on. This piece was actually the reason I started recording in the first place. I, once more, had a score to settle. Once again, with myself.</p>
                <p>Several years after learning this piece, I fell into a rut and got distracted with work and other things. As I sought to regroup, I sat down to play this and found myself staring at the piano with nothing more than an orderly arrangement and black and white keys staring back at me. The hand positions that once mentally overlayed the piano had completely vanished.</p>
                <p>To my dismay, I had completely forgotten how to play it.</p>
                <p>Not wanting to lose more pieces to antiquity, that was the point that I decided that I was going to re-learn... and keep them there. Instead of juggling many in-progress tunes that never reached a real point of completion, I was going to pick the ones I wanted to keep and see them through to the point that I could acquire a clean recording of them. That, was the new challenge. The satisfaction was no longer from being able to roughly play my way through a piece... I had to do it properly.</p>
