                    <li>
                    <h3>Composed by:</h3><p>Ludwig van Beethoven</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Heard in:</h3><p>So many places...</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>This song will forever remind me of my brother.</p>
                <p>We're one of those brothers who are, at once, completely alike yet incredibly different. My brother is laid-back to the point that my parents regard him as being horizontal, despite drinkingly vastly more coffee than I. Whereas me, the only thing I need to be high strung is a good excuse. (Commuting, people, life... yadda yadda yadda...)</p>
                <p>We are both, however, mischievous. Never in a malicious way. But, much to our respective wives' exasperation, if we see an opportunity to pull a funny which has them stifling a smile whilst they shake their heads and sigh... we will take it (a bonus if you can make your brother laugh too). I have no one else to blame for this but him.</p>
                <p>Now, to anyone watching this video thinking "ah, at last! Something not related to computer games!" I am so very sorry.</p>
                <p>My first real introduction to this lovely piano piece by Beethoven (to the point that I was able to hum it from memory) was none other than Earthworm Jim 2 - A game that my brother and I played on the Sega Mega Drive in the mid-1990's. It was a level called - and I quote - "Jim's now a blind cave salamander" which was... well... exactly as the tag-line foretold. There you were gently swimming around an intestinal planet (oh yes, did I mention that?) avoiding pinball bumpers, sheep that sounded like old women and then got to round it all off by starring in a quiz show.</p>
                <p>As you do.</p>
                <p>Now conditioning is a powerful force to behold. It makes dogs salivate and brothers make silly noises.</p>
                <p>As you could probably tell from the level's description, Earthworm Jim was, shall we say, not exactly "run-of-the-mill". The off-beat level was adourned with equally fitting sound effects, the aforementioned old lady noises, wacky "wrong" answers and Jim's iconic wail if he took damage.</p>
                <p>The problem, of course, was that where this was our first foray into this lovely piece of classical music, we were instantly transported back to that level if we ever heard it. What this meant was, any time then that my brother and I heard this on the likes of ClassicFM (our mother was the cultured one) we'd always gleefully cheer "It's Earthworm Jim!" and start making weird noises from the game.</p>
                <p>My mum tried. She really did.</p>
                <p>The important bit though is that, 15-od years later, my brother did not let me down. I had brought my keyboard home from uni and decided to share my learned songs with him. As soon as I played this for him... Yep. He did it. I'm so proud of him.</p>
