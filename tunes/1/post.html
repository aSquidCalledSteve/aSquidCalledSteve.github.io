                <!-- Dedication: Game Music -->
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>It was a good day at university when I discovered that the music from the Final Fantasy games were kicking about on YouTube. In the space of an evening, I was transported back to all of the locations and events that I loved from the games during my childhood (mentally adding my own limit break noises over the battle music, of course).</p>
                <p>It's fair to say that computer games had a big impact on my imagination. My friends and I used to play 'Guardians' in the school playground ('boss fights' is probably the more appropriate term now), which consisted of us being pitted against an imaginary foe of the other's creation. Don't get me wrong, I had plenty of other hobbies: I read, drew cartoons, rode on my bike and did the usual kid stuff. But there was something really neat about games in their ability to take you to another world and have you play a starring role within it. Films are okay but have stupid people doing stupid things (like turning to the dark side or trying to take the ring from Frodo) and have you shouting "No. Don't do that, you dork". In games, that stupid person is you and you have no one else to blame when you fall through that trap door.</p>
                <p>What would make these journeys especially exciting though was a cracking soundtrack. Finding a game with great music was a special kind of win, similar to my last day of primary school where I was allowed to get a slice of pizza <em>and</em> a portion of meatballs at lunch (suck it, Year 6).</p>
                <p>Good music was like having a musical narrator following you round, commenting on the scenery and getting you in the mood for whatever seemed appropriate at the time (I could never understand my brother's thing of playing with the sound off). Do you know that friend who psyches you up before that big interview? Imagine if they were still there cheering you on <em>during</em> the interview too, only it had the opposite effect of you getting kicked out by security and blacklisted by a major FinTech employer (again).</p>
                <p>That was game music. Always in the background, egging you on and setting the tone. It was like a trusty companion on your adventure that always knew the right thing to say.</p>
                <p>The perculiar thing about the music though is, not only how it can define the game, but also take you back there. Even if I hadn't played the title in years, just hearing the music sent me back to the trials, discoveries and victories. That was the strangest bit about rediscovering those tracks on YouTube... everything came flooding back.</p>
                <p>In many respects, I guess that's why I have a soft spot for games soundtracks. Hearing them always takes me of on some little silly adventure, even if I'm not doing anything at all. I could be doing the laundry, filing paperwork or working on this very website... but somewhere else I'm sat with a controller in hand, taking in the sights and determined not to be bested by whatever is thrown my way (and <em>maybe</em> occasionally launching my controller into the floor. Maybe).</p>
                <p>As I had just started the piano at the time I rediscovered these tracks... it was only inevitable that the two would cross paths at some point. The first  visit would obviously have to be to the work of Nobuo Uematsu, the talented composer behind many of the classic Final Fantasy games.</p>
                <p>But where to begin?</p>
                <p>Me being me, I obviously tried for the boss music... but it turns out that thrashing guitars, sick basslines and phat beats don't exactly translate to piano very well. So I came to my senses and started on something more appropriate instead.</p>
                <p>Enter Balamb Town (even if that meathead Zell lived there). Having never tried what is essentially Japanese classic music, I opted for something that seemed straightforward. It's a surprsingly simple piece, which is in part why it's always stuck around. It is the perfect warm-up tune and gentle starting point of every piano session. As such, it seemed only fitting to give it the first spot.</p>
