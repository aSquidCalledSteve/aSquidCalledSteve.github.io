                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Steven Cravis</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Game:</h3><p>Quell</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>The <cite>Quell</cite> series was a gateway drug for me for puzzle games.</p>
                <p>I was always a fan of puzzles, but these were in books or tucked away in newspapers. I jumped on the Sudoku train as a teenager and escalated to penning my way through Kakuro books on my commute. The problem was that I was wary of it on my computer.</p>
                <p>I was lucky to grow up with a Windows 95 that my dad had procured from work. It gave me a jump-start on the likes of Word and Excel, and I'd spend time drawing lions and tigers in MS Paint. It also didn't take long for my brother and I to discover its other gems: <cite>Solitaire</cite>, <cite>Minesweeper</cite> and <cite>3D Pinball Space Cadet</cite>. (I gave up on the latter after my brother dominated the entire leaderboard for it).</p>
                <p>It got worse when we upgraded to the Windows XP and mum discovered <cite>Spider Solitaire</cite> as well. My dad was understandably a little miffed that were using an expensive powerhouse of machinery for a card game (oh the irony of where smart phones ended up 10 years later). He had a point though. Compared to a living, breathing dungeon of beasties, a deck of cards is a tad easier to replicate in real life (and less likely to have knights bashing your front door in). I took to leaning towards games that actually put the computer to some use, and even uninstalled <cite>Solitaire</cite> on my university PC so I wouldn't be distracted by it.</p>
                <p>Not that it helped much. This was the era of Flash games, so you never had to look far for some gimicky little title (in its defence though, there were a couple of brilliant ones out there).</p>
                <p>As such, receiving <cite>Quell</cite> from my brother seemed a little strange at first. I'd only known it as a Mobile game at the time, so it seemed a little scraggly to be sharing a home with <cite>Dawn of War</cite> and <cite>XCOM</cite>. Nuclear explosions would be a regular occurence when <cite>Supreme Commander</cite> showed up, and there <cite>Quell</cite> was, quietly humming to itself in the corner.</p>
                <p>It was, however, beautiful.</p>
                <p>Though simple in terms of graphics and what it required from the PC, it was hard not to be mesmerised by it. The music was wonderful and the look and feel was gentle and inviting. A few weeks later, my brother and I were racing each other through the game and, if one of us got stuck on a level, would drop little tips for each other that were later dubbed BroHints<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
                <p>It firmly kicked the door open to puzzlers being serious players in my gaming sphere, carving a patch for the likes of <cite>Baba is You</cite>, <cite>Opus Magnum</cite> and <cite>Patterna</cite> to occupy.</p>
                <p><cite>Solitaire</cite> remains uninstalled though, as it shall always be.</p>
