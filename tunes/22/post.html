                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>Given the name "Adventure Intro", it seems strange that this is one is the finale of the second compilation of covers. In a curious twist of irony though, its naming and position became quite apt.</p>
                <p>Having wrapped up the second collection in what felt like a neat bow, the obvious question was now what the third collection should look like. I had flirted with the idea that the third being the one where I basically re-learned all of the pieces I'd previously forgotten and finally get some decent recordings of them down.</p>
                <p>A few songs in and I started to run into a problem, however. My musical style had changed. The computer game covers, especially the pair of closing <cite>Tidalis</cite> tracks, had sparked a very different sound for the piano for me. One that I enjoyed considerably more than the chord-thumping of yester-year. Pop songs (at least in the way I played them at the time) were grudgingly just no longer hitting the spot. I had a taste of the sound I wanted from the piano, and my style now had to play catch-up. Curiously, it was whilst writing up these DVD Extras that I really started to sit down and think about what I wanted from the piano. What did I want to be sitting with in a years time?</p>
                <p>There were a number of pieces I was eyeing up but sidelining for compilation number four or five... But then I thought "why am I waiting? Why am I purposefully <em>not</em> playing the pieces I have the most interest in?"</p>
                <p>Around that time, I was also very fortunate to start finding a few interesting albums (which will be topics of their own) and piano musicians that crafted interesting covers that played more to the piano's strength. I had an angle that I previously thought impossible and additional music theory in the jazz/blues sphere that I realised I should probably pay attention to.</p>
                <p>And then I emigrated. That kinda threw a spanner into the works too. Away from my trusty Arius, I found myself in the company of a baby grand piano in a church hall for my practice. I was woefully unprepared for the incredible sound it produced though. Imagine playing a xylophone where every note you tap sets off a stick of dynamite beneath your seat. That was my experience with the baby grand. Most of the pieces carefully recorded and honed were now sounding explosively terrible when amplified. I thought the jump from keyboard to Arius was bad... This was something else, to the point that I initially played with ear plugs until I got used to playing with such a volatile instrument. On top of new ideas and new theory, I might as well have been sat at an entirely new instrument. It appeared that I had much to learn and re-learn. It was glorious.</p>
                <p>And so it was, that as I concluded my second compilation, the adventure was indeed only just beginning.</p>
