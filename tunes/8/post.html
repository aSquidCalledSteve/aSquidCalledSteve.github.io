                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>The Shins</p>

                <p>My brother and I shared a room for pretty much for all of the time we were growing up. Given the potential for chaos (particularly as I was quite the hot-head), we were strangely tame compared to most other stories we heard of siblings. We'd get impatient or in each other's way from time to time, but it mostly ended up in sulking and huffing more than anything else.</p>
                <p>To be fair though, that's because my brother is 5 years older than me. He'd absolutely kick my ass if we had ever actually got into a scrap. Worse, I was incredibly ticklish and he knew this. My only survival mechanism was to curl up like a hedgehog in the corner and plead for mercy. I might have been a hot-head, yes... but I wasn't stupid enough to have a death-wish.</p>
                <p>What also helped was that the room was cleanly divided into two, as evidenced by the fact that one half was covered in gig tickets and posters of <cite>Oasis</cite> or <cite>The Strokes</cite> whilst the other had posters of <cite>SpongeBob</cite>, <cite>Warhammer</cite> and <cite>Garfield</cite> the cat (spoiler: my side was the cool one). We had our own territory and were pretty good about respecting each other's space.</p>
                <p>We were also very good at sharing Switzerland: The small peninsula of carpet that sat between our beds. This was where the <cite>Playstation</cite> resided. Surprisingly, there were very few diplomatic incidents over this hallowed ground, except the one time when my brother hid <cite>Final Fantasy VII</cite> because I was starting to get ahead of him in the story. Hey, it's not my fault he had started secondary school and now had homework to do.</p>
                <p>Curiously though, our game tastes didn't exactly align. There was one exception, however: <cite>V-Rally</cite>. We discovered this gem at our aunt's one year and pleaded with Santa to get a <cite>Playstation</cite> that Christmas. My brother was considerably better than I was though, even when I learned that I could take the first bend by going full-pelt into his car and using the ricochet to bounce me round the corner whilst throwing him off the track. One of us saw this as a professional racing game, the other saw it as a demolition derby. I think the only reason he put up with me was because he'd keep winning.</p>
                <p>Other than that though, there wasn't much overlap. This wasn't strictly down to different interests though... What tended to happen was that my brother would discover a really cool game, then I'd watch him play it, get super into it and then he'd lose interest now that his lame brother thought it was cool. <cite>Dungeon Keeper</cite>, <cite>Age of Empires</cite>, <cite>Final Fantasy</cite>, <cite>Metal Gear Solid</cite>... you name it. They were all his games initially. He was the visionary who scouted the food source, I just stuffed my face with it.</p>
                <p>This started to peter out in our teens though. At the point I was becoming proficient at gaming, I went from watching my brother in awe, to laughing at his mishaps (I may have been kicked out of the room once or twice). Whether it was him alerting an outpost as the rifle he'd been given wasn't as silenced as he assumed it'd be, or an Iron Giant jumping on his creature repeatedly. He went from showing the ropes to a young squirt to having an imp on the TV, chuckling away and hoping more things would blow up in his face. Switzerland occasionally needed a time-share. Let's just say that.</p>
                <p>We also didn't really clash musically, in part because I didn't listen to it until my mid-teens. For the most part, we simply brokered an uneasy truce where my brother controlled the airwaves but allowed me my random explosions from the TV. Whilst it may sound like a recipe for some intense bickering, what it meant was that I had a lot of exposure to his music (and he to my explosions). He was quite the avid collector and guitarist, and had pretty much converted his shelves into a small fortress of CD cases. So it was a very generous spread of influences.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, over the years, the odd track would jump out. One of the most notable was <cite>Phantom Limb</cite>, by The Shins. It was the chorus that got me. Having recently discovered the joy of albums with <cite>X&amp;Y</cite>, I wanted to know more about this band and borrow the album. <cite>Wincing the Night Away</cite> was probably the third album I'd ever acquired and sparked a small obsession with <cite>The Shins</cite>. They were one of those niche bands that few knew of, but those who did you'd always get to share an excited &quot;Oh you've heard of this band too!?&quot; like it was a well-kept secret. At uni my Danish flatmate, Mads, was one such rarity and we'd jam out <cite>New Slang</cite> on the guitar and keyboard respectively.</p>
                <p>Though <cite>Phantom Limb</cite> caught my eye, it was definitely <cite>Girl Sailor</cite> that kept me around. Despite the otherwise jovial chords, there's a bittersweetness to it and the lyrics that I just couldn't get enough of. It also sounded more interesting on the piano, which helped a lot too. Barely anyone recognises it, but when they do there's the sly exchange of smiles as if we both know some sort of well-kept secret.</p>
                <p>What can I say though, I was lucky. My brother is the visionary who scouted them... I just stuffed my face with it.</p>
