                <ul class="summary">
                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Steven Cravis</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Game:</h3><p>Quell</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>I have Steven Cravis to thank for a number of things. His music helped to make the <cite>Quell</cite> series a beautiful zen-tastic puzzler to while away many evenings perched on the back table with my headphones on. Even if I couldn't best a tough level, I'd rest my head on my hands and basically zone out to the music.</p>
                <p>His real blessing, however, was to save me from weird parents and crying fans.</p>
                <p>I had wrapped up my first collection of songs, which I sometimes unaffectionately regarded as "my least hated piano pieces" and found myself staring into the void somewhat. Where on earth did I want to begin with the second album?</p>
                <p>Save for a few tracks, classical piano just didn't seem to interest me very much. I'd been to an orchestra and witnessed the Gollum of piano basically claw his way through a rap battle with himself via piano keys, which is a story in itself for another time. The problem for me was, instead of classical music stirring deep emotions within me, I'd see the squirming faces of <em>other people</em> for whom classical music stirred deep emotions within and were now gushing over its superior importance like we'd just shared a naked commune together over it. You know how, as a kid, you learn that the more that weird stuffy people tell you that something is good for you, that it's probably a con? Like broccoli. Now, I <em>like</em> broccoli, but the more that unhappy-looking health experts espouse the virtues of what broccoli does to your poop, I want it less. Follow the logic?</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for me, that conditioning tended to trample over everything else like a bull had just been unleashed into a children's petting zoo and spanked really hard. I just wasn't excited by the idea of music that had strong connotations with middle aged men in powdered wigs, sycophants and parents who use their kids as weapons in an arms race of smugness. <cite>Fantasia</cite> was great as a kid, but that was more when my brother added his own commentary over it.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, pop music was also starting to come up short, especially with the realisation that a solo piano couldn't quite live up to a band (at least if you tried to beat them at their own game). You cannot strum a piano and, unfortunately, when a piano <em>did</em> single-handedly carry a piece... it was often in really, really drippy songs. I revelled in them as a teenager and, having gotten over feeling sorry for myself at university, had little inclination to head back that way. I also wanted people to enjoy my work, not tell me how it reminded them of being dumped at a hotdog stand.</p>
                <p>Now before I receive a ton of scolding e-mails... let me be the first to say that I'm keenly aware that piano music takes many more forms than the above two genres and that my limited piano inspiration utterly stank. As I skimmed my iTunes library, I noticed that I hadn't really aligned myself to very many piano players. Though my musical tastes were varied, my piano diet was little more than gravel.</p>
                <p>In hindsight, the problem was pretty straightforward: I knew what I <em>didn't</em> like on the piano, but only had a scant idea of the sort of sound which I actually did.</p>
                <p>As I dozed off to another game of <cite>Quell</cite> one evening, I eventually noticed the distinct piano that was running through a majority of the tracks (especially in the later games). Its appearance was very timely.</p>
                <p>The music of <cite>Quell</cite> had precisely what I'd been looking for: Relaxing music to chill out to. It wasn't trying to stir anything deep but was simply something uncomplicated that you could just mellow out to of an evening. I loved the idea of music that you can simply enjoy and that be the full extent of it. Nothing more. Nothing less. Better still, music that comes from computer games is like garlic to classical music vampires.</p>
                <p>And as luck would have it, Steven Cravis had gone to the trouble of creating the sheet music for the first trio of songs in the <cite>Quell</cite> soundtrack. I purchased them without hesitation so that I could finally get a look at the sort of notes and chords was under the hood of these tracks and went into building this type of music. It created an exciting new avenue to look into and a much-needed new angle for the piano.</p>
