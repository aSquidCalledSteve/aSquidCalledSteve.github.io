                <h2>The Scientist [Piano Cover]</h2>
                <ul class="summary">
                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Coldplay</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Album:</h3><p>A Rush Of Blood To The Head</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>This was the first full piece I learned on the piano having purchased a keyboard at university. Though if I'm being pedantic, there were 3 nursery rhymes before it, at which point I got bored and immediately wanted to jump to something with a bit more bite to it.</p>
                <p>This was also the first piece I performed in front of other people, and by other people I mean "one unfortunate sod". The recipient was Andrea, an Irish teacher who lived in the flat below me at university (and had politely put up with me playing <cite>How to Save a Life</cite> more often than it probably should have been throughout the year). We'd normally hang out in the hallway with strong Irish coffees and ginger snaps after she came back from placement. She also joined me in being freaked out and useless when a giant bumblebee flew into my room and got trapped there. We were real adults... I think?</p>
                <p>By now, it was the end of the term and most of the students had already packed up and left for the summer. Being one of the few friends still about on campus, Andrea accepted the mini-conert (I can't remember if she had requested this or I had volunteered... but either way, it sucked to be her in that moment). I ferried my keyboard down to her flat and she let me put on <cite>The Scientist</cite> as a backing track as this was long before I started working the vocals into the piano playing, so I was literally just playing the piano component of it. It gave her something to listen to and let me pretend I was in a band. Everybody won.</p>
                <p>Even if a little samey, I managed to hit the notes I was supposed to and received a polite applause. It was lovely. To be really honest though, I'm not a big fan of playing in front of people.</p>
                <p>I don't think it's so much performance anxiety. Anyone who has seen me give a speech will know that I have no qualms releasing my inner-diva at the spotlight and having my voice go full-on sonicboom to fill the auditorium if I'm ever handed a microphone (I still love my friend, Brooke, for citing my spirit animal as 'Brian Blessed'). I think the more accurate term may be '<em>appreciation anxiety</em>'.</p>
                <p>I can't quite put my finger on it... but receiving praise in front of other people gives me the jitters. Don't get me wrong, I like recognition as much as the next person, but being put on a stage and having the audience told "applaud for this man!" makes me want to climb down, crawl under a rock and have the applause redirected to someone else. Awards evenings at school were the worst.</p>
                <p>Part of it may be not knowing exactly what to <em>do</em> with it. Any kind of bowing just feels like I'm pulling out a hand-held vaccuum cleaner and trying to suck up as much appreciation from the stage as I can get my grubby little hands on. Piano is particularly difficult as well, as you often have your back to people, so any applause tends to ambush you.</p>
                <p>My worst offence was in Canary Wharf on one of the "Play me, I'm yours" pianos that were stationed out in the plaza by the train station (it was very cool, a company basically set up pianos around the city for a while that you could just walk up to and play). I snuck on before work and had just finished a round of <cite>Clocks</cite> before heading in. I nearly jumped out of my skin as I suddenly heard one person to my left clapping pretty emphatically.</p>
                <p>I had no idea what to do so did the only thing that seemed appropriate: Run.</p>
                <p>I hastily glanced at my watch almost as if to say <em>"Whoops! I'm late for work"</em>, grabbed my bag and pegged it without even looking back. I never saw who they were.</p>
                <p>I felt awful. There someone was appreciating a little piano cover, and I ran off without even acknowledging them. To this day, I still don't really know why I did it. More to the point, there doesn't really seem to be a <em>right</em> outcome either, as playing to a vacuous round of indifference is equally as unsettling.</p>
                <p>The only winner was perhaps a random guy who, mid-song exclaimed "THIS MUSIC MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE" and started excitedly rapping over it all. It made little sense, as <em>The Shins</em> are not known for their rappability... but screw it, that guy was having a whale of a time and I got to enjoy making a racket like a kid banging dustbin lids together.</p>
                <p>Andrea, at least, received a hearty thank you and a hug after the first play of <em>The Scientist</em>. As a first foray onto the stage musically, I confess it was a guilty pleasure to enjoy the limelight... albeit only a little bit of it.</p>
                <p>Back to my rock, with maybe a packet of ginger snaps.</p>
