                <p>If you're looking for the accursed cause of my musical tastes and interest in the piano... then you're looking right at it.</p>
                <p>Any time-travellers wanting to ensure I picked up something like accounting instead: This is the track you'd need to ensure never got released (though I'd raise broader questions over your priorities with a time machine in your possession).</p>
                <p>As a teenager, I opted for the mushy strain of surliness. What this meant was, whilst some peers opted for black clothing or death metal, I went for being mopey and <cite>Magic FM</cite>; a drippy radio station featuring Phil Collins and about 5 other songs in its entire setlist (though it didn't have DJs trying to be funny, which was a massive tick in its favour). Mum used to have it on in the car when we'd be driving back from swimming lessons as a tyke... and it turned out that, 10 years on, the track list hadn't really changed. At the very least then, everything had the warm familiarity of evening drives in the car with a portion of chips, only Phil Collins was driving and being really annoying about it.</p>
                <p>"Speed of Sound" was one of those rare songs that mesmerised me on the first listen. The resonant opening notes wrenching my attention from whatever it was I was doing and made me listen to every word. I didn't know who this band were or what magic lay beneath these notes. All I knew is that it wasn't Phil Collins.</p>
                <p>Now this was 2005, so the radios weren't fancy enough to have illuminated screens telling you what the song was. You instead had to pray that the DJ would tell you, and that was normally a bit of a dice roll. Alas, the song vanished without me ever knowing who was behind it.</p>
                <p>It was only several days later that I heard something on the TV - the chorus. I ran into the living room and saw it was an advert for the album <cite>X&amp;Y</cite> by some kind of a "Cold Play" (whatever the hell that was). I had never listened to an album in my life, but the advert repeatedly taunted me with its 10-second snippet of the song before switching to something else. Like a siren call, I was repeatedly drawn to a rocky death by the harmonious temptations of <em>"and birds go flying..."</em> from the TV. A rocky death being naff adverts about biscuits and life insurance.</p>
                <p>And thus it finally happened. I grabbed my Christmas gift voucher and scurried off to a UK branch of Woolworths (which apparently <em>did</em> sell more than pick n mix). I eagerly left with <cite>X&amp;Y</cite> in hand, got home, tore off the plastic covering and listened. It was the first album I had ever acquired in my life.</p>
                <p>And it was awful. I was clapped round the face by the vivid realisation that the album consisted of "Speed of Sound" and 12 other songs that were distinctly <em>not</em> "Speed of Sound". I was betrayed.</p>
                <p>See. This is why I didn't do albums. Thankfully, the sunken cost fallacy was there to catch me. I'd just burned my Christmas money on Coldplay instead Garfield comics... so I figured I might as well at least attempt to enjoy the decision.</p>
                <p>Luckily, that was a decision which worked out well. Not only did I discover that songs can grow on you (especially when you stop expecting them to be a carbon copy of another song), but albums as a whole also have their own story through the music beyond the hit singles. Until the fourth album, <em>Viva La Vida or Death And All His Friends</em> pinched its place, <cite>X&amp;Y</cite> (all of it) became a staple of my teenage years.</p>
                <p>More importantly, the resonant opening notes of "Speed of Sound" (and later "Clocks") struck an ever deeper impact. Prior to then, I'd always seen the piano as the hoity-toity fancy guff of classical music in the same way that I believed that you'd only pick up an acoustic guitar if you wanted to sing like a farmer, or an accordion if you hated life. (That said, I think the last one still has merit).</p>
                <p>"Speed of Sound" was the first time I'd really heard the piano play a key role in music and sound amazing. Though it would be a number of years before it became a reality, this was the song that first put the idea in my head: I wanted to play the piano.</p>
