                <ul class="summary">
                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Pablo Vega</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Game:</h3><p>Tidalis</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Heard in:</h3><p>Game's title screen (where I instantly fell in love with it)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>If there is such a thing as a 'Happy Song', this would be it. Hands down.</p>
                <p>I was captivated by the game, <cite>Tidalis</cite>, immediately on the loading screen where I was greeted by a boat on the waves and this tune. It was mid-winter in the UK at the time, cold and dark, so this was basically an inviting escape to a warm, tropical island.</p>
                <p>Perhaps strangely, then, I have guilt to thank for this piece more than anything.</p>
                <p>To tell the truth, I had been wanting to play this song for <em>years</em>. As the original is performed on a xylophone, it wasn't too difficult to picture how it could sound on the piano. I just never had the guts to give it a try. There was no sheet music, so I'd have to figure it all out by myself. It was always one of those things that I earmarked as "I'd like to try that when I'm better" which, as anyone else who's made similar pacts will know, generally means "never".</p>
                <p>That was until I was nearing completion of the second compilation of piano covers. I like to arrange my recordings into albums, mainly as I hate having singles floating about my iTunes, masquerading as albums. I like to get swept away on a little journey with each an album, rather than be presented with a few sweets and shown the door.</p>
                <p>As my second collection was entirely computer games covers, I had already settled upon the name <cite>Hollow Tides</cite> in my head, in a homage to <cite>Hollow Knight</cite> and <cite>Tidalis</cite>. I liked the ring to it, probably because I'm a sucker for anything with an aquatic twinge to it (except cruises. There's something deeply unsettling about being trapped on a vessel with children's entertainers and shuffleboard enthusiasts).</p>
                <p>However, with two songs left to complete and no sign of <cite>Tidalis</cite> anywhere in the album yet, I had to face a difficult choice: Change the title or suck it up and learn the damn pieces. I couldn't call it Hollow Tides and <em>not</em> have <cite>Tidalis</cite> music in there. That's just dumb and silly and dumb.</p>
                <p>Whilst a trite thing to labour over, Hollow anything else just didn't sound as good. Not now that I'd already settled on the name. Everything else was pants in comparison. <em>Hollow Chocobo</em> screams more of a budget horror movie than an ode to computer games.</p>
                <p>The second thing to push me over the edge was looking back at all of the recordings and realising that I only had one song learned by ear. Considering I had somewhere in the region of 10 years of piano under my belt, I confess I felt a bit sheepish at only having one attempt actually recorded, especially as I'd come out with quite a few back in my third year or so. Whilst there was obvious merit in learning songs directly from the sheet music (especially where I was still trying to figure out the sort of sound I wanted), I also realised that I was putting off trying at all.</p>
                <p>I looked back at my promise of "when I was better" and figured that if 10 years wasn't good enough to give it a shot, then I was never going to come close.</p>
                <p>And the rest is... well. You can see it above.</p>
                <p>And that is how a bizarre blend of unwavering continuity and guilt kicked the ass of nervousness. Whilst they're not your regular superheroes, I have them to thank for finally snagging me this piece.</p>
