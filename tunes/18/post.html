                </ul>
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>As much as I love the music of Resting Grounds or City of Tears... Dirtmouth is probably my favourite spot in <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>.</p>
                <p>You wouldn't think of it when you turn up... the place is desolate, save for a cold-looking iron bench and one inhabitant, the Elderbug, who is happy to speak to you and tell you about the place. It's easy to scoff when he tells you that the bench is rather comfortable.</p>
                <p>Now before you get the wrong impression, this isn't the sort of stuff I generally dig. I'm much more of a curl-up-under-50-blankets kinda person than punish myself out in the elements. The only fun I ever had camping was my friend, Sean, keeping us up late making up weird songs about sweets as we'd get bored after 2 minutes of trying to sleep and instead decided chocolate was a much better idea. The following day I tripped up on a tent rope and fell onto a knife. So yeah. Screw camping.</p>
                <p>What gave Dirtmouth its charm was, (being careful not to spoil anything here), that as you started to understand the unfolding events in <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>, the town became a little pocket of respite. As you emerged from the well, the creepy gales of the outside world became a welcome relief as you could say "well whatever is going on in that well can stay there" and just chill on the bench with Christopher Larkin's excellent piano work in the background. You know how, when you get off a plane, you get the thrill of real air and not recycled beer farts? It's like that. Only <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>'s beer farts are much worse (and often pointy).</p>
                <p>Through very clever design on the part of the developers, the ghostly emptiness of Dirtmouth became welcoming. The lack of anything also meant the lack of danger.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have a lot of love for the Elderbug.</p>
                <p>I think, in part, it's because we're both curmudgeons. He just cannot fathom why so many abandoned the town in pursuit of a hair-brained adventure with high certainty of death.</p>
                <p>I can absolutely relate to that. Sure, adventure can foster exciting tales and growth, but then there's the whole dying thing which I'm not such a big fan of. Even if, every now and then, someone may pop up from the well to Hallownest, talking about the growth they gained on their adventure... I'd take a peek down the well, see the trail of dead bodies of other like-minded adventurers who had the same idea, and just nod politely.</p>
                <p>That's not to say I don't like adventure. My problem is that I like it too much. Give me a set of skis and I'm a little speed demon who will chase the fastest person on the hill (which once resulted in a rather terrifying backflip). In go-karting I ploughed into the wall of tyres trying not to be lapped by the reigning champs who practiced there weekly. The first words I received from my horrified-looking friend was "I thought I was going to have to find another Best Man there". I appreciate it's not really an adventure if there isn't the risk of idiotic amounts of self-inflicted pain...<cite>Harry Potter and the expired shopping coupon</cite> probably isn't going to win any literary awards (though I'd totally read it). However, I echo my dad's advice when I mentioned that I was considering giving motorcycling a try: "Don't get into it unless you're willing to get pretty injured from it".</p>
                <p>This wasn't a case of him being stuffy and boring... He was recounting this from experience, having himself had a go at a number of speedway circuits. He picked up a number of injuries from biking, some of which still hamper his ability to play the likes of guitar, but he took them in his stride because he loved biking that much.</p>
                <p>Considering I had my artwork and piano to think about, it kicked my priorities into place. And that place was later on an iron bench with a fellow curmudgeon who'd really wish things stopped being quite so dang hectic.</p>
