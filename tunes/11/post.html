                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>Believe it or not, this was actually the second piece of music I ever learned to play on the piano.</p>
                <p>I appreciate it was a pretty bold decision to make, fresh out of the starting blocks (and obviously, it took me <em>ages</em> to learn). But I didn't care. If I could pick out the notes, I was adamant that I could string it together.</p>
                <p>To be honest though, the abrupt ballsiness of the decision shared a lot with how the piano came about in the first place for me.</p>
                <p>I'd been intrigued by the idea of the piano for a number of years. I had wanted to play it but, like being an astronaut, learning another language or abstaining from that tub of ice cream, it was one of those things that you say you <em>want</em> to do but never actually follow up on.</p>
                <p>The closest I got to it was a really naff keyboard that my parents had kicking out in the spare room somewhere. It was pretty awful; its default instrument was a squeaky trumpet because it didn't actually have anything on its sound bank that sounded even remotely close to a piano. My brother and I just used to do silly dances to the two (yes, two) demo tracks before the keyboard was (understandably) taken away.</p>
                <p>But then I met Patrick at universiry. Patrick was a charming gent who became my closest friend and flatmate. He was sincere, driven and had a good business acumen (though, in the interests of balance, would also pilfer your food if you didn't lock it away).</p>
                <p>In April of our first year, he did something really weird. (We did many things that were weird, but only this particular one is relevant).</p>
                <p>He told me: "Steve, I feel like learning the piano. I think I'm going to go and buy one" and the next day went out and purchased himself a keyboard.</p>
                <p>Just like that.</p>
                <p>I say this with full sincerity: I was completely thrown.</p>
                <p>Wait... you can just <em>do</em> that? Here I was umm'ing and ah'ing about the playing the piano for years and never doing anything about it. And now I'm looking at Mr-never-mentioned-music-before just go and buy himself a musical instrument because he just <em>decided</em> to learn it.</p>
                <p>I couldn't fathom how you could go out and buy an instrument like it was a pint of milk. Everyone knows that big life decisions need epiphanies and Mufasa telling you that you're the chosen one. You don't just get to start on a path because you feel like it.</p>
                <p>... Can you...?</p>
                <p>Well screw you, Patrick. If you can just <em>make a choice</em>, I'm going to as well. How do you like those apples, Patrick?</p>
                <p>And so it was. The very next day I ran out and purchased the exact same keyboard (though mine was more expensive as he had managed to swing a haggle on his - of course he did). It was surreal. Despite staring at the decision for several years, I was now learning the piano. Is this is what autonomy felt like? I really expected that there would be more to it.</p>
                <p>With a start like that, I wasn't about to pussyfoot around with nursery rhymes. I had songs I'd been dreaming about playing and, more to the point, I now had a rival to beat.</p>
                <p>Naturally, Pat and I became rivals (though we never admitted this). It was pretty obvious becaise whenever one of us came out with a song we learned, the other would <em>coincidentally</em> choose to learn that piece too shortly after. It was great though, and kept us both pushing ourselves musically. We were massively hampered from 0 years of music lessons and experience... but screw it, we were going to jump that gap anyway.</p>
                <p>With a gauntlet like that, I think the question here wasn't "why on earth was "Clocks" the second song I learned?" and more "why not?"</p>
