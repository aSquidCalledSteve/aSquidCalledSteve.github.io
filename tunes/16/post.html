                <p>Ah, <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>, now there was a game!</p>
                <p>And to think that I almost refunded it.</p>
                <p>I've learned a couple of useful things over the past few years. The first is never to buy a game at the end of the week. You're not in much of a position to enjoy anything when you are completely bushwhacked from work. Though I normally like to associate crossing the finish line with getting a little treat, it's generally overriden by the overpowering desire to curl up and hide for a while.</p>
                <p>The second is that I get <em>really</em> bad buyer's remorse.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, my games tend to catch the brunt of it. Games are a luxury, especially as I already have a healthy collection of titles to work my way through, so it's not like I'm bored or chomping at the bit for something new. More to the point, any new title I embark upon will displace another game that was queued up to be played, so there's that too. Nothing puts you off getting a game more than looking a cute baby orphan game in the eye and telling it, once again, that it won't be getting any food today because Ironhide just released another <cite>Kingdom Rush</cite> title (spare a thought for <cite>Batman: Arkham Asylum</cite>, as that's been on my to-play list for... 10 years now?)</p>
                <p>The result is me mulling over whether the Â£0.99 I spent on <cite>Sonic CD</cite> in the Steam winter sale was really such a good idea. Now, given everything else in the world, this is a very nice problem to have. It is also the source of great amusement for my wife, who seems honed in on when a game is actually worth returning and when I'm just flapping (at which point she flicks my forehead and tells me to sleep on it). Heck, even if my wife buys me a game, I will feel buyer's remorse on her behalf.</p>
                <p><cite>Hollow Knight</cite> was no exception.</p>
                <p>The crux of the problem was that I went in expecting more of an in-your-face high-octane 2D platformer. I grew up with <cite>Sonic the Hedgehog</cite>, so fun involved moving so uncontrollably fast that you keep running into everything (this is also why, for everybody's safety, I'm not much of a skier anymore). <cite>Hollow Knight</cite>, on the other hand, greeted me with eerie silence and ominousity. (That needs to be a real word, and fast).</p>
                <p>After aimlessly wandering around the crossroads with no idea where to go or what was going on, my favourite Steam-Game-Syndrome kicked in on cue and I considered returning it. My wife thought the game looked very pretty however (that, I couldn't deny) and considered getting it herself.</p>
                <p>Now this may have evoked a similar reaction to when you try and take a cat's food away from it. It arches its back and is like "well now that <em>you</em> are going to enjoy this, I will!". My inner-cat grabbed the game and decided it might not be such a bad title after all. I stuck it out and, only a short foray later, was in Greenpath. That's where the magic began. The world felt more alive and the music had started to become almost magical. It was at that point I started to feel the chilling creep up my spine that said "this game might be something special". Once I arrived in the City of Tears... it had well and truly cemented its place there. Much like any ambient album, the music nestled under and grew. Considering Christopher Larkin's elegant use of the piano in many of the tracks, this game was a goldmine, not only in its enjoyment, but in the musical ammunition I had now acquired to fill out the next collection of tunes.</p>
                <p>And I still got my high-octane, tough-as-nails battles in the end. (<cite>Hollow Knight</cite> fans should be laughing about now at that pun).</p>
