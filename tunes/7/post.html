                <ul class="summary">
                    <li>
                    <h3>Original by:</h3><p>Coldplay</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Album:</h3><p>X&amp;Y</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Liking the music of Coldplay was a surreal experience.</p>
                <p>They picked up a reputation early on of being both drippy <em>and</em> boring and it took hold quite firmly. The more they became popular, the louder this backlash became. Anyone flying their flag was quickly ushered into the realm of uncoolness as Coldplay become the go-to punching bag by people who wanted to assert their superior musical tastes.</p>
                <p>The result was tiptoeing around like the resistance during occupied France in World War 2. You couldn't reveal your identity willy-nilly for fear that the musical Gestapo would have you shot for poor musical taste, so you instead had to subtly feel-out for a potential fan with code phrases like "Hello, do you have the time? I have an important meeting with <em>The Scientist</em>". "Why yes, I do have the time. I get it from all these <em>Clocks</em> I have". At which point you are welcomed into a small underground bunker where you get to share in the fact that you don't think Coldplay's music is terrible.</p>
                <p>Over time though, I learned a neat survival trick. You know the dads who put on scary masks to spook their kids? Well, I learned that if I jumped out at people shouting "BOOGA BOOGA! I don't think Coldplay's music sucks!" I could often revulse and scare the repicient long enough that it'd give me a sufficient window to chuck down a smoke bomb and somersault out from what would have otherwise been an awkward converation. If I wasn't <em>ousted</em> as a fan, I could retain the initiative.</p>
                <p>Of course, this didn't stop the flak. I once had a dubstep-obsessed workmate who found it so inconceivable that I could like this music that he hypothesised that I probably only liked it due to a form of behavioural conditioning of hearing this music at meaningful moments in my life (everything else here might be hyperbole, but this bit most definitely isn't).</p>
                <p>I knew my place though. The ColdCaste would forever be judged for their poor musical taste and I accepted that as the way of life. I'd whittle my time in the underground resistance movement, playing lesser-known B-sides in the background until someone would trip-up and remark "who's this? They sound good" at which point I'd declare "IT'S COLDPLAY! YOU JUST ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD! YOU ARE NOW MINE!" having successfully kneecapped their ability to pass judgement.</p>
                <p>It was when I joined the gym that this changed, however.</p>
                <p>Modern gyms are like being in a discotheque. Everything is illumated and there are TV's everywhere trying to make the place look hip and groovy (weirder, though, was my work gym which had stock reports on one screen and <cite>Cash in the Attic</cite> on the other). They'd pound out the latest chart music because heaven forbid you'd want to listen to your own tunes when working out.</p>
                <p>Though I'd been exposed to club music before, the bass tended to drown everything out and I was too busy trying to look like I was having fun to pay attention to it. In the gym, however, I was on an immovable bike for half an hour so had plenty of time to absorb the lyrics and get distracted by the TV's.</p>
                <p>And boy, was I confused. In between flashy bling and weird hand gestures that looked like the world's smallest karate chops... Nearly everything was griping about break-ups, crappy exes and being lovesick... just with phat beats over it. Despite the fact that the lyrics were flashing on screen in neon lights... They were nothing more than multiple derivations of "I like you, so why aren't you mine? This is so unfair."</p>
                <p>Not even huge subwoofers could mask that.</p>
                <p>I was steamed. I'd want to get off the bike, angrily point at the TV and shout "No, <em>you're</em> the whiny one!" (and probably get thrown out for roughhousing again). I can accept Coldplay's lyrics being drippy.... but what confused me was discovering that pretty much most other music also was. They weren't singing about anything different at all. They were just hiding it behind looking cool. I felt a little cheated as this had been hailed as the <em>cool stuff</em> that sings about <em>deep stuff</em> and it most definitely wasn't that.</p>
                <p>At that point, the veil was lifted. The cat was out of the bag and I was covered in enough scratches to know that it wasn't going back in. What lifted was the notion that my library and musical tastes had to ascribe to some kind of expectation. For all my enjoyment of Coldplay, there was always a defiant guilt behind it. I'd fill my iTunes with artists, not because I strictly liked them, but because I felt that I <em>should</em> because they were hailed as "greats" or "classics". I discovered a few gems (Imagine Dragons and Muse being two prominent ones), but at the point that I realised the only music I should actually bother with is what I actually enjoy, I gleefully consigned many others to the recycle bin.</p>
                <p>Music had suddenly become simpler. Computer game soundtracks started becoming more prominent (now making up about 10% of my library) because... who cares if it's uncool? I liked them. Though Coldplay's later work left me cold (no pun intended), their albums retain their pride of place. No smokebombs necessary.</p>
