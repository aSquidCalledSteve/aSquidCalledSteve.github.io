                <p><cite>The Highlands</cite> was a fascinating lesson in surprises.</p>
                <p>Of all of the 22 covers at the time, this is the one I'd least expect to make any kind of splash. It's a niche game and its soundtrack isn't even anywhere on <cite>YouTube</cite>. So I hardly expected anyone to even recognise it, let alone enjoy it.</p>
                <p>Funnily enough though, surprise was a common theme with its game, <cite>Renowned Explorers</cite>.</p>
                <p>I spied the game mid-2017, but passed over it as I wasn't confident that it'd be my thing. For whatever reason, it reappeared on my radar again in 2019 so decided to give it a try. Just as well. I took to the game very quickly and had an absolute blast with it. I didn't expect it to be quite so tongue-in-cheek yet challenging. My wife got me the DLC and soundtrack in the 2019 Easter sale. The reason I recall it so distinctly was that we were in Australia at the time, visiting her folks. The music became my soundtrack for that trip, in part because it seemed very fitting. Sure I was nipping down the road to get coffee, but this was <cite>Australia</cite>. Any patch of bushland would certainly be riddled with snakes and spiders waiting to jump out at you, so any trek was an adventure. If I could have worn a pith helmet, I would have. (Why yes, I was a tourist. How could you tell?)</p>
                <p>On return to the UK, I was wanting a bit of a kick-start to the piano, and having really taken to <cite>The Highlands</cite> on my travels, fancied a challenge of trying to piano it, especially noticing that the piece had a waltz structure to it. I figured that it could be done.</p>
                <p>It was quite the mission, I must say. Who'd have guessed that transposing drums, bagpipes, brass and woodwind to one piano would be quite so... hard. But I figured if I wanted to learn how to craft piano compositions and figure out pieces by ear - That jumping in at the deep end was as good a place to start as any.</p>
                <p>I finished, but wasn't exactly thrilled. It was good enough as a first real foray into improvising and trying to figure out my own spin. But that was about it. Recording wasn't much better, as this bugger took 70-od attempts over two days. I uploaded it out more for completeness than anything.</p>
                <p>On a whim, I swung an e-mail to Abbey Games, the developers behind <cite>Renowned Explorers</cite>. I've tried to make a habit of sending appreciation to creators, as it can sometimes be a nice treat in their inbox, even if it's a little rusty.</p>
                <p>What I didn't expect was the reply (I was half-expecting a "what have you done to it!?" if I'm brutally honest). It was, without a doubt, one of the most moving replies I had ever received. The abridged version was that they were basically having a pretty crap time of things and this gesture meant a lot to them. I was utterly stunned and had no idea what to say.</p>
                <p>Though it may appear self-indulgent to recount this story, I share it for a very key reason: To any content creators out there, it's true what they say when you never really know what will land and what won't.</p>
                <p>Years ago, I was reading the inset for the <cite>Oasis</cite> B-side album <cite>The Masterplan</cite> (ironically, my favourite album of theirs) and it mentioned how some of the pieces were originally dismissed by the band; <cite>Stay Young</cite> or <cite>Half the World Away</cite> but were surprised to see them so well-received by fans.</p>
                <p>A lot of creative individuals I know tend to run into the same disheartening frustration: Throwing content into what seems like the void. Until you snag traction, it can feel like you're dumping nothing onto an ever-increasing heap of nothing (and even once you get a following, the doubt apparently doesn't go away). When growing up I remember reading many now-famous cartoonists saying that they could basically wallpaper their house with the number of rejection replies they received.</p>
                <p>The reason why I remind myself of the above story, and why I wanted to share it, is that there's always merit to seeing something through to the end if you're already most of the way through it. At the point you've been working on something for a long time and doubt starts to seep in, it's very tempting to just ditch it and ensure it never sees the light of day. If you're nearly there and sick of it: Put it out there anyway.</p>
                <p>Because you never really know what may land or may mean a lot to someone. You could create a humble OST that became the soundtrack of a random tourist's holiday as they scurry around suburban Australia in their own little wack adventure. Now isn't that just weird?</p>
