                <p>"Death Will Never Conquer" is very much the black sheep of my piano family.</p>
                <p>I was a loud kid. Not boisterous... just loud. It was predominantly that whenever I got emphatic about something cool (which was often) my outside voice would rock up. As I noticed that it tended to spook the parents of kids much quieter than I, I picked up on this and reigned it in over time (then unlearned it all at university).</p>
                <p>Strangely enough, I ran into a similar problem with my piano. Like probably most enthusiatsts, I derived great joy early on from mashing chords on the keyboard in a bid to mimic my favourite songs. Whilst they were obviously broadcast to entire stadiums on professional speakers the size of a house, I figured I could basically compensate on my cheapo keyboard with the force of my playing. It was a blast!</p>
                <p>In my defence though, there was a slight necessity to this. Cheap keyboards aren't particularly powerful. The notes they make are so damn puny that you actually have to go pretty nuts to garner much in the way of noise. As such, it also made them very forgiving. You know how you give small children foam swords instead of real ones so that no one dismembers anything? The same logic applies here. No screaming or trips to A&#38;E (though that may depend on my choice of song and hour of the night I played it at).</p>
                <p>Now imagine if you suddenly gave those kids real swords instead? You can picture the mayhem, right?</p>
                <p>Well, that was me upgrading to the Yamaha Arius (the electric piano in these videos). Screams, crying kids and everything. It is a beautiful instrument. It has fully weighted keys and a rich, resonant sound... but boy did it pack a punch. I suddenly found myself pummeled by the noise of playing with the same gusto as I did on my keyboard.</p>
                <p>The recognisability of the song was often sufficient to mask the cacophanous wall of sound being launched into the faces of everyone within a mile radius. Thrash out the chords of "Viva la Vida" and you would almost always get someone sticking around to listen. But once the novelty faded, the notes would basically smash into each other and turn the once powerful wall of sound into a pungent swamp of noise.</p>
                <p>With that, I had to buck up and reign it in, not even for other people's sakes... I was spooking myself with my own noise. None of the songs just sounded good anymore thrashed out on the piano.</p>
                <p>Well... With one exception.</p>
                <p>For some reason, "Death Will Never Conquer" is always a blast to play. It's not one to hold back on either. It's one of the only songs that seem to actually benefit from a healthy dose of gusto. Part of the reason that it's always stuck around (in addition to just being so damn fun to play) is that it is, in part, a thorny puzzle for me. Why, when pretty much every other song died in a screaming mess of chords, does this one take it on the chin and demand more?</p>
