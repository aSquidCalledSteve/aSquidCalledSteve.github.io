                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>Like a lot of people growing up in the late 1990's, Final Fantasy VII made an iconic impact on my childhood. The story was great, the limit breaks were rad and the game spanned a whopping 3 CD's which you had to manually swap out. Like many, I was also left stunned by the unspeakable hammerblow of a game killing off one of the main characters right in front of you (after having built them up as a love interest at that).</p>
                <p>And, of course, the music was incredible.</p>
                <p>As I was working more of Nobuo Uematsu's pieces into my repertoire, I realised that I had made a horrible mistake... Despite VII being my all-time favourite installment, I hadn't learned a single one of its pieces.</p>
                <p>Oh sure, there's always Aerith's Theme. But it's such a sad piece and I'm angsty enough as is. Twist the knife some more why don't you.</p>
                <p>More importantly though, and this is where I'm going to upset a lot of people... I'm also much more in the court of Team-Tifa.</p>
                <p>This wasn't always the case, however. On our first playthrough, my brother likened Tifa to Smurfette (and named her such) as she seemed to spend the first portion just moaning at Cloud (in my brother's defence, he also named Cloud and Barrett "Conan" and "Monknose" respectively to make me laugh, so I wouldn't read too heavily into his choice of names). Aerith, on the other hand, had the aura of a gentle, loving teacher. She seemed the sort that, if you dropped your ice cream, would pat you on the head and bake you a fresh assortment of cookies. Tifa, on the other hand, would probably crush the ice cream under her boot and punch you in the face for being stupid enough to drop it.</p>
                <p>We were quite harsh on Tifa though. When one ally carries a human-sized sword around and the other has a machine gun <em>for an arm</em>... you're never exactly going to look impressive bringing knuckle dusters to a fight. Spinning backflips are neat and all, but not as neat as launching a super-powered fireball from your forearm. We never kept her in the team long enough to discover that she could punch enemies with a dolphin (which, I'll concede, is pretty neat).</p>
                <p>More importantly though, Tifa was actually the sensible one. After all, she didn't run off on her own to take on the genetically-engineered nutter <strike>Liquid Snake</strike> Sephiroth and get killed in the process.</p>
                <p>That always bothered me though. Not the fact no one thought to use a Phoenix Down or do anything about Sephiroth flying in from the ceiling (more to the point, how long was he sitting up there?)... What bothered me was how Aerith even got to the City of the Ancients on her own in the first place. Did you see what the path was like? When I tried to follow her tracks, my entire team were ravaged by midges who made them poisoned or berserk. Getting whooped by Sephiroth is pretty believable. What wasn't believable was how we didn't find Aerith slumped over on the pavement, covered in mosquito bites.</p>
                <p>Game logistics aside though, Tifa's Theme is just such a lovely piece. There's a gentle, inviting warmth to it that belies whatever rubbish might be going on outside. In fact, if I didn't know any better... is that the smell of freshly baked cookies?</p>
