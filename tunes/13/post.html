                <p>"Distant Hearts Longing (Part 2)" is an important lesson into the importance of recording your work. Not only do you notice more things on playback than when you're actually doing it, you can also find its experience to be very different.</p>
                <p>Now I'd been caught out by this before. I'd throw myself into a piece and have a ball playing it, but when listening back would hear the dirge of the same bass note repeating in four-four time basically slathering itself over everything else.</p>
                <p>This piece was a tough one to learn as it featured a lot of quick notes which, half the time, seemed to get in each other's way. The melody was one parent on the steering wheel, the bass was the other with the map, and there I was in the backseat with my Game Boy hoping we didn't get obliterated or pulled over (or worse, obliterated <em>and</em> pulled over). Of the <cite>Quell</cite> trio, I actually disliked this one the most.</p>
                <p>Then I did something really wild, and recorded it.</p>
                <p>It's just one of those things you see people who are super into their craft do. Record themselves then studiously watch it over and over. Just like how I helped my university buddy, Andreas, practice Jui Jitsu. His favourite mantra was "The Danes throw the best parties", and it transpired that the Danes were also pretty good at throwing punches. He filmed us and then had us re-watch and critique his technique of repeatedly faceplanting me. Considering he now instructs others how to faceplant people, it must have worked. I normally waited until I had finished a song before trying to record it, but decided to give it a go on a whim whilst still learning these ones. My "wax-on, wax-off" moment was the voice of Sensai Andreas telling me to record my work and faceplant my piano (I ignored the last bit).</p>
                <p>And a good thing to, as I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this one the most. For some reason, the sound just seemed to gel. Mum and dad were no longer arguing in the car, but we were instead parked outside the Lego store with an 100%-off sale for people called Steve. This was even when playing and listening back on the exact same pair of headphones, so it's not like acoustics were the obvious culprit. All I knew was, it sounded very different to how I experienced it when playing. Trying this with a few other songs, it was strange to find that some of the more awkward-sounded elements were the most interesting on playback. Somewhere in Denmark, a Jitsu black belt was probably also smiling knowingly around the same time.</p>
                <p>The second surprising bit was how <em>loud</em> it was.</p>
                <p>I thought I was playing pretty quietly, but was a little taken aback at hearing myself basically thrashing out the <cite>Anvil Chorus</cite> on a glockenspiel with a pair of mallets. Every note became a musical cotton bud rammed into your ear canal which, as any who have tried knows: One is strangely enjoyable, two or more at once makes you go deaf. (Disclaimer: Don't actually try this)</p>
                <p>Though the video may look like I'm giving it some welly... the truth is that I was barely glancing the keys most of time, to the point that I was often missing notes in practice by not hitting them at all. I had learned a little counterintuitive reality: Playing vibrantly doesn't mean you have to play forcibly. That's what the speakers are for. Just like singing, a rich sound actually requires less gusto than you may suspect it would. It's easy to assume that unless you feel like you're throwing yourself into it, that you're not putting in much effort.</p>
                <p>Curiously though, this wasn't the first time I've seen this lesson. I'm pretty sure that I've previously come across something else that taught the importance of precision over power. And if I didn't know any better, I'm pretty sure that it also involved a Danish man and me smooching a crash mat repeatedly.</p>
