                    <li><h3>Game:</h3><p>Final Fantasy VII</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Heard in:</h3><p>The town 'Kalm' (before the whole meteor thing)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <!-- On meteorites and Seproni -->
                <h3>DVD Extras:</h3>
                <p>Ah, Kalm. Now <em>there</em> was a lovely town!</p>
                <p>Kalm was the first town you enter in <cite>Final Fantasy VII</cite> after the game did the really neat thing of leading you out of the city of Midgar to reveal to you a huge, exciting world map to explore. Given the frenetic events leading up to this point, there was something incredibly idyllic about touching base in Kalm. It was lovely and encapsulated the innocent excitement before going off on a big adventure. I wanted to live there - The roofs and pavement were a midnight blue, giving the town an almost magical vibe to it.</p>
                <p>And then the whole meteor thing happened. Thanks a bunch Sephiroth. I rock back up at Kalm and what do I get? Some ominous "things are pretty bad" music. What gives? I know the world is about to get destroyed, but come on... Have you seen how cool the roofs look?</p>
                <p>The Golden Saucer was still pretty chipper. Costa Del Sol got to keep its happy-beach music. No matter how many times I kicked a football at Red XIII's face, he still took it and everybody had a great time in spite of potentially being blown into smithereens.</p>
                <p>But Kalm. Noooooooo. It's not Kalm any more. It's now the disappointing, smouldering husk of <em>Kalamity</em>. Sorry pal, you have to go elsewhere for your cheerful music. For that, I had quite a beef with Sephiroth.</p>
                <p>That said though, I sort of also owe him an apology.</p>
                <p>I was a pretty literal kid. My reading ability was on the ball and I had little trouble with books, subtitles or game dialogue... with one exception: Names.</p>
                <p>See. Fictional names were a little problematic for me. As most were completely made-up, there was almost never any context for me to derive their pronunciation from.</p>
                <p>My solution was to glance at the letters and make a wild guess. It was like combining phonetics... but in a blender. As such, "Heidegger" became "Hedge-hiker" (I have no idea where the 'k' appeared from) and Bugenhagen became "Buggen-ham" (hey, I was sort of close).</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, they were not the worst recipients of this. You can probably guess the poor sucker who was.</p>
                <p>'Sephiroth' is a hard word. There's a lot of weird combinations of letters in it. But there were a few noticable ones: S, e, p... and I was pretty sure I saw an r, o and an i somewhere in there.</p>
                <p>And thus, was born: "Seproni" (<em>Seh-proh-nee</em>).</p>
                <p>Yes. Seproni. The game's biggest antagonist, breaker of hearts and summoner of a world-destroying metrorite was now reduced to a cross between an Italian Mafioso and a brand of salami. A man who probably shouldn't have been armed with the Masamune, but instead a wide variety of exotic spices and tasty flavours.</p>
                <p>Yes. Seproni.</p>
                <p>I thought it was a strange name for a bad guy, but considering that the protagonist was called <em>Cloud</em>, something I understood as less surly and more white and fluffy, I went along with it.</p>
                <p>I cannot recall how long he retained that alias before someone (likely my brother) corrected me. But it was a while. That's for sure.</p>
                <p>Coming strangely full-circle. I remember chatting about <cite>Final Fantasy VII</cite> with my good friend, David, in 2019 as we ominously discovered that we were both listening to the game's soundtrack at work. The story of Seproni came up, and this very quickly devolved into an alternative universe of Sephiroth's side hustle at Domino's Pizza. And then it happened.</p>
                <p>I don't remember which of us spotted it. But Domino's had a particular, very popular, pizza on their menu at that time.</p>
                <p>It was <em>The Meateor</em>.</p>
                <p>I tried my best, Kalm. But we were no match for Seproni.</p>
